/**
 * Defines the mechanisms for attaching and detaching the "current" context. The constructor for
 * extending classes <em>must not</em> trigger any activity that can use ThreadContext, which
 * includes logging, otherwise it can trigger an infinite initialization loop. Extending classes
 * must not assume that only one instance will be created; ThreadContext guarantees it will only use
 * one instance, but it may create multiple and then throw away all but one.
 *
 * <p>The default implementation will put the current context in a {@link ThreadLocal}. If an
 * alternative implementation named {@code io.grpc.override.ContextStorageOverride} exists in the
 * classpath, it will be used instead of the default implementation.
 *
 * <p>This API is <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/2462">experimental</a> and
 * subject to change.
